âš¡ Simple file uploading service written in go!

## TODO:

- [ ] [Basic Auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#Basic_authentication_scheme)
- [ ] Automatic deletion after N amount of days (size dependent)
- [ ] SHA256 hash to check for duplicates (also reupload if the file is going to be deleted soon)
- [ ] Dockerfile for "easy" daemonizing (super overkill, especially considering the portability of go, but it's the only thing I know /shrug - better option is simply to use systemd)
