# up!

âš¡ Simple file uploading service written in go!

## TODO:

- [x] [Basic Auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#Basic_authentication_scheme)
- [x] Automatic deletion after N amount of days (size dependent)
- [x] SHA256 hash to check for duplicates
- [x] Reupload if the file is going to be deleted soon
- [ ] Dockerfile for "easy" daemonizing (super overkill, especially considering the portability of go, but it's the only thing I know /shrug - better option is simply to use systemd)
- [ ] Refactor with structs?
- [ ] Tests lol
